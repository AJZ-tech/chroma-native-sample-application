# Razer ChromaSDK Sample Application (C++)
This is a community maintained version of Razer's official sample application written in C++. This allows us as a community to provide more sample effects, improvements and maintain best practices.

## Keeping up-to-date

*While every effort is made to ensure the sample application is updated to support the latest SDK version, there is a chance that issues do occur due to your SDK version being out of date. Please ensure you always update to the very latest version of Synapse before you [submit an issue][newissue].*
